      Number using O6 output only:           1,614
      Number using O5 output only:             588
      Number using O5 and O6:                2,174
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     59
      Number with same-slice register load:     25
      Number with same-slice carry load:        34
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,222 out of   1,430   85%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                     2,732 out of   2,860   95%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        4,451
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         3,367 out of   4,451   75%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  16 out of   4,451    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,068 out of   4,451   23%
    Number of unique control sets:             122
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             696 out of  11,440    6%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
